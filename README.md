# mysql-operator
mysql kubernetes operator built using the operator-sdk

```
brew install operator-sdk
```

```
$ operator-sdk version
operator-sdk version: "v0.15.1", commit: "e35ec7b722ba095e6438f63fafb9e7326870b486", go version: "go1.13.6 darwin/amd64"
```

```
operator-sdk new mysql-operator --repo=github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/mysql-operator
cd mysql-operator
```


```
operator-sdk add api --api-version=cache.codingbee.net/v1alpha1 --kind=MySQL  # kind needs to start with uppercase
```

This would have created a crd and a sample cr file, that you can try deploying at this stage. They look like this:

```
$ cat deploy/crds/cache.codingbee.net_mysqls_crd.yaml 
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: mysqls.cache.codingbee.net
spec:
  group: cache.codingbee.net
  names:
    kind: MySQL
    listKind: MySQLList
    plural: mysqls
    singular: mysql
  scope: Namespaced
  subresources:
    status: {}
  validation:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      description: MySQL is the Schema for the mysqls API
      properties:
        apiVersion:
          description: 'APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation
            of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest
            internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources'
          type: string
        kind:
          description: 'Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this
            object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client
            submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds'
          type: string
        metadata:
          type: object
        spec:
          description: MySQLSpec defines the desired state of MySQL
          type: object
        status:

          type: object
      type: object
  version: v1alpha1
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: true
```

and the sample custom resource (cr):

```
$ cat deploy/crds/cache.codingbee.net_v1alpha1_mysql_cr.yaml
apiVersion: cache.codingbee.net/v1alpha1
kind: MySQL
metadata:
  name: example-mysql
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 3
```

Added custom setting to pkg/apis/cache/v1alpha1/mysql_types.go. 

For these changes to get propated to the rest of the repo, run:

```
operator-sdk generate k8s
```

Next run the following to get the changes reflected in the crd file:

```
operator-sdk generate crds
```

Now let's create our operator's controller:

```
operator-sdk add controller --api-version=cache.codingbee.net/v1alpha1 --kind=MySQL
```
This ends up creating the file `pkg/controller/add_mysql.go` and the folder `pkg/controller/mysql/` along with all it's content.


Next update controller to make use of the mysql env vars - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/mysql-operator/blob/6e4610c2931bb7ff5dfb140b3a8b8feaec484fe7/pkg/controller/mysql/mysql_controller.go#L150-L166 and 
https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/mysql-operator/blob/6e4610c2931bb7ff5dfb140b3a8b8feaec484fe7/pkg/controller/mysql/mysql_controller.go#L137



Now deploy the crd (you can also deploy the example cr too if you want too):

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/cache.codingbee.net_mysqls_crd.yaml
```


Update the controller to use the mysql image, rather than the busybox image. 




Now deploy the operator. Theres 2 ways to do that. deploy it as a pod, or run it locally. 

### Deploy operator as a container

First build an image that has your controller baked in:

```
export account=sher_chowdhury
export image_name=mysql-operator
export tag_version=v0.0.1
docker login quay.io
operator-sdk build quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
docker push quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
sed -i "" "s|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}|g" deploy/operator.yaml
```



Now we do the deployment (assuming crd was already deployed, see above):


```
kubectl apply -f deploy/role.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

check the operator pod is now up:

```
kubectl get pods
```


After that we can deploy our example cr:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/my-mysql-db-cr.yaml
```

Then check if if worked:

```
kubectl get mysql
kubectl get pods
```

if it didn't work. then take a look at the operator's pod's log:

```
kubectl log mysql-operator-xxxx
```


if you find the problem, fix it. Then redeploy newer version of the operator and retest, do:
```
export account=sher_chowdhury
export image_name=mysql-operator
export tag_version=v0.0.1
operator-sdk build quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
docker push quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
kubectl replace -f deploy/operator.yaml
kubectl replace -f deploy/crds/my-mysql-db-cr.yaml
```

Once your mysqldb pod is present, you can test it:

You can test your pod by running:

```
kubectl exec -it <mysql-pod-name> -- bash
mysql -u root -h localhost -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

Then in the msyql prompt, run:

```
show databases;
```

This will end up listing the "wordpressDB" database. 



## Now add a service object

here we've added a service object - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/mysql-operator/commit/a6f8df1a8bbde96a0f041ab137672d4d4361f3e8

The main changes have been done to the pkg/controller/mysql/mysql_controller.go file. We had to add 3 sections:

1. A new watch block for the service. This watch block will in trigger the reconciler if and when it notices a change has occured. It does that by putting something onto a queue. 
2. A new block in reconcile function - this calls the third function, then starts the actual loop. Inside this loop it tries to create the object. The loop exits once the object in question is created. Otherwise it keeps calling itself from inside the loop.  
3. created the new newServiceForCR. This function just generates the yaml file that will get used to create the object. 




Now perform a retest. First we redeploy the updated operator and recreate the cr:

```
export account=sher_chowdhury
export image_name=mysql-operator
export tag_version=v0.0.1
operator-sdk build quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
docker push quay.io/${account}/${image_name}:${tag_version}
kubectl replace -f deploy/operator.yaml
kubectl replace -f deploy/crds/my-mysql-db-cr.yaml
```


Now we can test this new mysqldb service by running:

```
$ kubectl run -it --image=mysql:latest client -- bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=wpAdminPassword
mysql -u root -h my-mysql-db-service -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
```


Then in the msyql prompt, run:

```
show databases;
```

This will end up listing the "wordpressDB" database. 


You should also try deleting your pods and services and it will get recreated by the operator.

##Â Testing

You can test your pod by running:

```
kubectl exec -it <mysql-pod-name> -- bash
mysql -u root -h localhost -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

Then in the msyql prompt, run:

```
show databases;
```

This will end up listing the "wordpressDB" database.
